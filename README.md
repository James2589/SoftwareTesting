#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code is functional and secure I try to ensure that I am following coding best practices. I also try to keep my code as simple as I possibly can to make it easy to check my code. In this class I learned how to use Junit5 testing to check my codes functionality by comparing to the expected results of my code. 

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs is always a challenge what I have found works best for me is going over the information that I was given. Checking all the requirements and then looking at how all these pieces work together allows me to begin putting the system together with integration in mind. By working on a system in this manner I get a higher view of the system which can then be used to inform my decisions in the code.

#How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software starts on paper, usually a roughly drawn UML diagram or similar to show how the system is meant to interact with itself. This allows me to collect my thoughts and organize the information given to me by the user. I am then able to go through my diagram and the user information to make sure I have accounted for all user needs. Once this process is done I have a basic blueprint for the system that I can then use to write my code. This helps keep everything organized and gives me an easy structure to follow throughout all my projects helping keep me consistent.
